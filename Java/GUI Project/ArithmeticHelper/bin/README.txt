===Description===
This is the arithmetic helper 
thing that you asked for. It's
done and you can grade it now.
You as in whomever it may concern.
Enjoy, but first READ my disclaimer.

===Disclaimers===
The classes will not function in
Eclipse as the IDE requires users
when accessing files to user the 
src folder so it's better to use
the JAR

The jar creates a file that stores
the history of users and if you 
want to see the sorting you must
run over and over again.

I have included a file alongside 
to test the sorting.
